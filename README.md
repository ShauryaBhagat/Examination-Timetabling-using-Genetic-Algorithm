Examination Timetabling using Genetic Algorithm

Preparing timetables for examinations is a major challenge for any educational institution where there are a large number of courses offered over several de- partments to hundreds or thousands of students. A timetable not only has to be acceptable but also be an optimal one from both the students’ and the in- stitution’s point of view. This holds true when the timetable meets all hard constraints and as much as possible soft constraints. Manually defining an opti- mal timetable for such problem size is not at all feasible. Genetic algorithm is a meta heuristic optimization methodology inspired by nature’s laws of evolution and is useful in solving multi-objective large and complex size of problems like timetabling. The main objective of this research project was to assess if genetic algorithm is feasible to solve timetabling issue or not. A detailed survey of pre- vious similar works was carried out and a genetic algorithm-based solution was implemented. Various techniques of implementing the genetic operators and values of hyper-parameters were used to perform experiments on a real world dataset. A set of results were obtained which were presented as a comparative analysis. It was concluded from the results, that genetic algorithm is an effective way to find ’good enough’ solutions which are very close to the best one.
